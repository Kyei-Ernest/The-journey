Ernest Kyei  
Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Now focused on becoming a Software Engineer(in Progress)  

About Me  
I am on a structured journey to become a Machine Learning Engineer, advancing step by step through software engineering and data handling before fully diving into ML.My approach is based on incremental progress, ensuring I build a solid foundation before moving forward.  

 Current Focus  
- BSc. in Software Engineering â€“ Building a strong foundation in programming, system design, and mathematics.  
- Microsoft Excel 2021 â€“ Advancing from beginner to expert-level proficiency.  
- Python for Data Analysis â€“ Learning Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to work with data effectively.  

Why Software Engineering First?  
I believe understanding software engineering is essential for machine learning, as ML models are often integrated into applications. Mastering coding principles, system design, and algorithms will prepare me to develop scalable and efficient ML solutions.  

Future Goals  
Once I strengthen my skills in software engineering and data handling, I will fully transition into:  
* Machine Learning & AI Development  
* Advanced Data Science Techniques  
_ Building and Deploying ML Models
