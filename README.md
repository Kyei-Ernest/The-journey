My name is Ernest Ampoma Kyei. I am currently on a journey to become a machine learning engineer through self-study and mentorship.

Goals and Learning Path  
Importance of Data  
In machine learning, data is crucial. I believe every machine learning engineer must have basic knowledge of data handling, both big and small.

Software Engineering Knowledge  
Understanding software engineering is essential since machine learning models are often integrated into software. I am currently pursuing a BSc. in Software Engineering, which includes mathematics courses to support this knowledge.

Mathematics  
A strong mathematics background is necessary for machine learning, which I am building through my university courses.

Current Studies  
Microsoft Office Excel 2021: From beginner to advanced levels.
Python Data Analysis Libraries: Learning Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to handle data effectively.
Future Plans
Once I solidify my foundation in data handling and software engineering, I will focus on mastering machine learning itself. This journey may seem ambitious, but I believe in the power of incremental progress and am confident I will achieve expertise in machine learning in the coming years.

I am open to internships right now and you can contact me through my email. "ernestkyei101@gmail.com"
